This is a Repair Kit script that on use can detect the type of vehicle and the proper radius for functionality by the hood of most
vehicles radius can be adjusted in client.lua. If has server checks to prevent being activated client side to prevent exploits. This will make it easier to repair 
motorcycles since using get vehicle in direction was a pain to hit the sweet spot on motorcycles.

Made by MaliciousSnip3r This has no support but should work with ESX legacy 1.9 and older as I set up the framework with a exports
and normal getsharedobj. I have tested on ESX legacy 1.9

Requirements
ESX legacy 1.9 or older
Not tested on 1.2 or older but could possibly work.
